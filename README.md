# DriveTest Date Checker
A Python script using Selenium that will open Google Chrome, visit the Ontario DriveTest website, enter my login credentials, and tell me if there are any available road test bookings in the next month within seconds. It saved me from manually checking for openings several times a day and helped me book my road test despite high demand and low availability.

Note: the DriveTest website recently enabled Cloudflare's quality control to guard against bots, so this may no longer work.
